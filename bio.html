        <h3>life story</h3>
        i was born at a very young age somewhere in the boiling heat of arizona<br/>
        i don't remember anything until i suddenly gained consciousness sometime in september,
        standing perfectly still next to a wall that i was facing away from<br/>
        my life was extremely boring until about the time i made a roblox account at the age of like 7
        under a username that my dad was using<br/>
        it was then still pretty boring but slightly less so<br/>
        at some point i changed my account's name to tripwiregamer and made a google email
        that i still use today<br/>
        over time i learned lua because i opened roblox studio once, went "what's this doohickey?", and
        accidentally absorbed the knowledge of metatables<br/>
        skip a few years and people kept making jokes about my username, which was fine, but it was the same joke
        over and over so i changed my username to notquitehadouken (abbreviated to nqh 90% of the time) and continued
        learning random programming languages<br/>
        i did pick up japanese at one point, which was useful because japanese is cool and good and definitely
        a language you should learn if you speak english and hate yourself<br/>
        i was in virtual school for my 7th and 8th grade years, up until i moved to a different town<br/>
        <h4>freshman year</h4>
        i entered high school with the classes of programming and spanish<br/>
        i also met my best friend, and the rest of my entire friend group<br/>
        and introduced myself in japanese like a weeaboo in front of my entire science class,
        which sealed my fate for the next 2 years<br/>
        i joined the esports team and played with two of my friends<br/>
        (don't get used to it they disappear in sophomore year)<br/>
        eventually i picked up space station 14 and started playing it regularly<br/>
        i learned most of what i know about C and computers in general<br/>
        <h4>sophomore year</h4>
        i am still in programming and spanish, but the spanish teacher is different<br/>
        i am in esports again<br/>
        i am one of two people in programming II, my one classmate being a senior<br/>
        i get into coding space station 14, where i learn most of my C# knowledge<br/>
        i am also taking two math classes, except my geometry teacher is racist<br/>
        friend graduates<br/>
        <h4>junior year</h4>
        said geometry teacher is now gone<br/>
        i am no longer in spanish<br/>
        i meet another friend in programming III who i have several classes with<br/>
        two more friends graduate<br/>
        <h4>summer</h4>
        i get a job and make $200
        <h4>senior year</h4>
        i make ~$400 a week in my minimum wage food service job<br/>
        programming IV is real and it's called independent study<br/>
        <h3>may</h3>
        i quit my shitty food service job because one day i decide "I hate this."<br/>
        <h4>july</h4>
        hooray i'm 18 now<br/>
        still no driver's license<br/>
        <h4>august</h4>
        i enter college for a CS degree<br/>
        lof has dipped because he is aware of the meteorology job market<br/>
        <h4>the future</h4>
        i graduate 2031 with a masters in CS<br/>
        lof is maybe in college because now that trump isn't allowed to be presdident, his future job has a possibility of existing again (see: NOAA layoffs)<br/>
        depending on how true me having a masters is, i either live on my own or i went "screw this" and went to live with lof<br/>

        <h3>Upbringing</h3>
        I was born on a day in San Bernardino, California.<br/>
        My first memory is of me looking at my dad and his friends from a tire swing.<br/>
        One time before I was born, the FBI busted down our door because someone was committing credit card fraud
        and sending the garbage they were buying to our house and my dad wasn't doing anything about it.<br/>
        I made one friend in California, watched his father gouge his leg on a snapped bike crank, then moved to Arkansas.<br/>
        On the first day of kindergarten, I moved my chair to the center of the room and got in trouble.<br/>
        During a test in first grade, I kept dropping my pencil until I got in trouble.<br/>
        In second grade, my teacher really wanted me to go to church for some reason.<br/>
        In third grade, I got made fun of by some kid named Jordan and my friend now, Chase, for being brown.<br/>
        In fourth grade, I got paddled because I didn't do my work.<br/>
        In fifth grade, I got paddled because I didn't do my work.<br/>
        In sixth grade, I got paddled because I didn't do my work.<br/>
        Gonna add more later.
        <h3>Now</h3>
        Cut all the way to my senior year and now I'm obsessed with weather and have a bunch of friends.
        (Also my friend from California's dad got shot and died.)<br/>
        I own several firearms and my favorite is the .300 Winchester Magnum.<br/>
        <h3>THE FUTURE!</h3>
        I'm either a meteorologist who's dead broke or a nobody who's dead. Or, I'm Darren.<br/>
