        <h3>life story</h3>
        i was born at a very young age somewhere in the boiling heat of arizona<br/>
        i don't remember anything until i suddenly gained consciousness sometime in september,
        standing perfectly still next to a wall that i was facing away from<br/>
        my life was extremely boring until about the time i made a roblox account at the age of like 7
        under a username that my dad was using<br/>
        it was then still pretty boring but slightly less so<br/>
        at some point i changed my account's name to tripwiregamer and made a google email
        that i still use today<br/>
        over time i learned lua because i opened roblox studio once, went "what's this doohickey?", and
        accidentally absorbed the knowledge of metatables<br/>
        skip a few years and people kept making jokes about my username, which was fine, but it was the same joke
        over and over so i changed my username to notquitehadouken (abbreviated to nqh 90% of the time) and continued
        learning random programming languages<br/>
        i did pick up japanese at one point, which was useful because japanese is cool and good and definitely
        a language you should learn if you speak english and hate yourself<br/>
        i was in virtual school for my 7th and 8th grade years, up until i moved to a different town<br/>
        <h4>freshman year</h4>
        i entered high school with the classes of programming and spanish<br/>
        i also met my best friend, and the rest of my entire friend group<br/>
        and introduced myself in japanese like a weeaboo in front of my entire science class,
        which sealed my fate for the next 2 years<br/>
        i joined the esports team and played with two of my friends<br/>
        (don't get used to it they disappear in sophomore year)<br/>
        eventually i picked up space station 14 and started playing it regularly<br/>
        i learned most of what i know about C and computers in general<br/>
        <h4>sophomore year</h4>
        i am still in programming and spanish, but the spanish teacher is different<br/>
        i am in esports again<br/>
        i am one of two people in programming II, my one classmate being a senior<br/>
        i get into coding space station 14, where i learn most of my C# knowledge<br/>
        i am also taking two math classes, except my geometry teacher is racist<br/>
        <h4>junior year</h4>
        said geometry teacher is now gone<br/>
        i am no longer in spanish<br/>
        i meet another friend in programming III who i have several classes with<br/>
        <h4>summer</h4>
        i get a job and make $200
        <h4>senior year</h4>

        <h3>Upbringing</h3>
        I was born on a day in San Bernardino, California.<br/>
        My first memory is of me looking at my dad and his friends from a tire swing.<br/>
        I made one friend in California, watched his father gouge his leg on a snapped bike crank, then moved to Arkansas.<br/>
        On the first day of kindergarten, I moved my chair to the center of the room and got in trouble.<br/>
        <h3>Now</h3>
        Cut all the way to my senior year and now I'm obsessed with weather and have a bunch of friends.
        (Also my friend from California's dad got shot and died.)<br/>
        I own several firearms and my favorite is the .300 Winchester Magnum.<br/>
        <h3>THE FUTURE!</h3>
        I'm either a meteorologist who's dead broke or a nobody who's dead. Or, I'm Darren.<br/>
